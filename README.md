Classification of Images of Cats and Dogs Using SVM
Aim:
To classify images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, leveraging machine learning to differentiate between the two categories based on features extracted from the images.

Platform Used:

Jupyter Notebook for model development and training.
Deployment:

Streamlit for creating an interactive web-based user interface to upload and classify images in real-time.
Language:

Python for implementing SVM, preprocessing images, and building the deployment interface.
